Each time the Muse headband fires off an EEG sensor update (order is: tp10 af8 tp9 af7),
the XvMuse class puts that data into XvMuseEEGPackets
and sends it here to create a streaming buffer, slice out epoch windows, and return Fast Fourier Transformed array of frequency data

The Buffers needs one object per sensor because it is storing an ongoing stream of data from each sensor. The epoch generator is just one object, but has an array of start times, since that's the only var that needs to be sensor-specific. And the FFT transformer processes different data each func call, with no data persisting inbetween calls, so I'm using one object to process the data of all the sensors (they all take turns sending in and processing their samples, getting their returned FFT data) */
